* DONE Day 03 - Mull it Over
Not a particularly efficient parser.
- could not a find an io function to read all the input from standard in.
- many functions from haskell are not present.
+ used a _data_ declaration for the first time. This is a lot more useful in idris since we can deconstruct on the each constructor case easily with ~idris-case-dwim~.
